## Suet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kehers/suet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kehers/suet)

Suet is an analytics dashboard and reporting tool for transactional emails through Mailgun or SES. It gives better insight into the performance of your transactional emails by providing answers to questions like:

- Who received what email? Which ones were opened? What links were clicked? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/suetco/suet/raw/master/public_html/images/screenshots/feed.png))
