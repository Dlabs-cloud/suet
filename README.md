## Suet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kehers/suet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kehers/suet)

Suet is an analytics dashboard and reporting tool for transactional emails through Mailgun. It gives better insight into the performance of your transactional emails by providing answers to questions like: 

- Who received what email? Which ones were opened? What links were clicked? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/kehers/suet/raw/master/public_html/images/screenshots/feed.png))
